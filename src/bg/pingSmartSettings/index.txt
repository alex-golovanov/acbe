Full functionality described in task BC-1229.

Ping requests to each server from SmartSettings countries (duplicates with non-existing URLs aka 'fake servers') to save auth credentials in cash and avoid Authorization popups from iframes.

Pings performed every ~1 hour.

On each run we are sending a request to every country's fake server to save auth in cache and prevent popups.
